## Business Problem
A leading car dealership is facing challenges in balancing inventory distribution and optimizing pricing strategies across new, used, and certified pre-owned cars. With fluctuating price trends and disproportionate inventory composition, the dealership seeks insights to improve inventory planning, price positioning, and ultimately boost profitability.

## Scope of Analysis

### 1. Inventory Challenges

A large portion of the inventory is skewed toward **new cars (nearly 59%)**, while **used** and **certified** cars account for a much smaller share. This could lead to **overstocking of new cars** while **under-serving budget-conscious customers** looking for used or certified vehicles.

**Key Business Questions:**
- Are we maintaining the right inventory mix?
- Which car categories or brands are over- or under-represented?

### 2. Price Optimization

Price trends indicate **drastic fluctuations in the value of new cars in recent years**. This raises questions about pricing strategy:
- **Overpricing** may lead to slower sales and inventory pile-up.
- **Underpricing** can impact overall profit margins.

**Key Business Questions:**
- How have prices evolved over time by status (New, Used, Certified)?
- Are Certified or Used cars priced competitively?
- Is there a correlation between pricing and inventory turnover?

## Insights & Recommendations
1. **Total Cars by Status**
  * Used cars dominate the inventory, indicating strong resale market activity.
  * New cars follow next, while Certified cars make up the smallest portion.
    
2. **Average Price by Status**
  * New cars have the highest average price, as expected.
  * Certified cars are priced higher than used cars, reflecting added quality assurance and warranty.
  * Used cars are the most affordable, catering to budget-conscious buyers.
    
3. **Top Brands by Total Sales Price**
  * Brands like Toyota, Ford, and Chevrolet lead in total sales value.
  * These brands likely balance volume with value, showing a wide consumer base.
    
4. **Yearly Price Trend by Car Status**
  * A dramatic spike in new car prices (~1.9B) occurred around early 2020s, possibly due to supply chain issues or pandemic-related           shortages.
  * Used car prices steadily increased, reaching around 0.20B, highlighting strong demand in the second-hand market.
  * Certified car prices remained consistently low, peaking only at 0.05B, suggesting limited market penetration.

5. Increase focus on used car inventory, as it holds the majority market share and steady price growth.
   
6. Promote certified cars more aggressivelyâ€”they offer better margins than used cars and attract trust-focused buyers.

7. Buyers seeking reliability and warranties at a lower price than new cars should consider certified pre-owned vehicles.
